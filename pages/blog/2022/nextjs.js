            <p>So, I was just watching on some reddit posts over in r/webdev and saw a lot of redditors ranting about how WordPress is taking over JS these days
             and few other tech stack circle jerks in the comments, and that&apos;s where I discovered the sense of &apos;&apos;btw, I use Arch&apos;&apos; emotion 
             among the Next developers.That&apos;s when I decided to experiment with NEXT and build my portfolio and blog on it.
            </p> 

            <p>Being the lazy person I am, I had to put a bet for myself to make a switch to this new technology, so I made a bet for my favourite thing
                about me. My hair, I would shave my head and get it shining smooth, in case I fail to build the app in 3 days.
            </p>
            <p> NEXT was built by Vercel, a company with which I have deployed some web applications in the past. So, yeah WHY NOT <b>Vercel</b> again.
            So, I went ahead and started with the <u><a href= "https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs">Start Learning</a></u> documentation.
